# Single responsibility principle: One class must be single responsibility.
# Open-close principle: Open for extension and closed for modification.
# Liskov substitution principle: Sub-class must substitutable for its super class
# Interface segregation principle: Client shouldnot be forced to depend upon interface  
# Dependency inversion principle: High-level module should not depend on low-level module. But both should depend on abstraction. Abstraction should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstraction.
